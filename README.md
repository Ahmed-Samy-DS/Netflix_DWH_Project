Project Title: ETL Pipeline for Netflix Dataset from CSV to MySQL with Data Warehouse Modeling 

Description:

This project builds an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, working with a Netflix dataset provided in CSV format. The pipeline extracts the raw data, applies necessary transformations using pandas and NumPy, and then loads the cleaned and structured data into a MySQL database.

The transformation process includes handling missing values, standardizing formats, and organizing the data to support analysis and reporting. The data is structured following basic data warehouse modeling principles, making it easier to perform analytical queries later.

This project demonstrates the core steps of an ETL process and shows how to prepare real-world data for storage in a relational database designed for analysis.
